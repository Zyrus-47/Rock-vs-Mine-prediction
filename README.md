**Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression**

This project focuses on building a Logistic Regression model to classify sonar signals as either Rock or Mine. The dataset contains 60 frequency-based features representing the energy returned by sonar pulses. By analyzing these patterns, the model learns to distinguish natural rocks from metal mines placed underwater.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing and normalization

Logistic Regression model training

Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

Prediction on new sonar inputs

Simple and easy-to-understand workflow

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

📊 Model Performance

The model provides reliable classification accuracy and demonstrates the effectiveness of logistic regression for binary classification tasks involving sonar signal data.

📁 Use Case
